Hi,

I am Harold Adodo Nikoue.
I am interested in using data to improve people's life.
I am currently working as a data scientist at WBD, and I am always learning and perfecting my skills.

My current goal is to become an expert at Deep Learning and master Reinforcement Learning.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate on interesting use cases.
