Hi,

I am Harold Adodo Nikoue.
I am interested in using code to improve people's life.
I am currently working as an operation research scientist / data scientist at WBD.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate on any cool project that uses Machine Learning or Mixed Integer Programming.
